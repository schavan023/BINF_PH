Course Title: Introduction to Bioinformatics for NGS Data Analysis

Course Description:
Are you a bench scientist with a keen interest in NGS data analysis, but limited experience in bioinformatics? Our "Introduction to Bioinformatics for NGS Data Analysis" course is designed for you. This course provides a foundational understanding of bioinformatics and equips you with the skills needed to start analyzing NGS data effectively. Whether you have a reference genome or not, this course will help you get started with fundamental NGS data analysis techniques.

Course Duration: 10 weeks (one semester) 

Prerequisites:
Basic knowledge of molecular biology and genetics
Familiarity with command-line interfaces (Linux/Unix)
Course Outline:

Week 1: Introduction to Bioinformatics
Overview of Bioinformatics in Public health. 
Introduction to NGS technologies and data types.

Week 2: Sequence Data Formats
Understanding FASTQ, SAM, BAM, and VCF formats.
Quality control and basic data preprocessing.

Week 3: Sequence Alignment with a Reference Genome
Introduction to sequence alignment algorithms.
Hands-on: Running alignment using tools like BWA and Bowtie with a reference genome.

Week 4: Variant Calling with a Reference Genome
Understanding SNPs, indels, and structural variants.
Variant calling with GATK or Samtools using a reference genome.

Week 5: De Novo Assembly
Introduction to genome assembly.
Hands-on assembly using tools like SPAdes or Velvet when a reference genome is not available.

Week 6: Functional Annotation
Gene prediction and annotation.
Enrichment analysis and functional classification.

Week 7: Comparative Genomics
Compare multiple genomes using tools like BLAST or Mauve.
Identify conserved and unique genes and genomic regions.

Week 8: Metagenomics Analysis
Introduction to metagenomics.
Analyze metagenomic data to identify species and functional genes.

Week 9 -10 - back up for anything that might come-up. 
All above will be done using CLI, and we will train users to use the services and resources that we provide.
