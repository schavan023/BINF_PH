# Data Alignment

Now we align the trimmed sequences to the reference genome.
I copied my trimmed sequences to the directory that has the index file (not needed). 

```
# aligned the trimmed sequences file to reference genome using samtools

bowtie2 -x reference_index -U SRR2621299_trimmed.fastq -S aligned.sam
# renaming the aligned file so I know or your could change above command 
mv aligned.sam SRR2621_aligned.sam
```
# Convert SAM to BAM
You can use the samtools view command to convert the SAM file to BAM format, which is a binary, compressed version of the same data. This makes the data more manageable and faster to process.
```
samtools view -bS -o SRR2621_aligned.bam SRR2621_aligned.sam

```
# sort the BAM file
```
samtools sort -o SRR2621_sorted_aligned.bam SRR2621_aligned.bam

```
# Index the Sorted BAM File:

To allow quick access to specific regions in the sorted BAM file, create an index file:

```
samtools index SRR2621_sorted_aligned.bam

```
